Purpose and general description of Carbon offset Unit (CoU) project activity >>
___________
The project activity titled, “20.5 MW Waste Heat to Power Bundled Project by M/s. Panoli
Intermediates (India) Pvt Ltd. (PIPL) in Gujarat, India”, is in Nandesari Village of Vadodara District
of Gujarat State of India. The project is an operational activity with continuous reduction of GHG,
currently being applied under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

The project activity is developed by M/s. Panoli Intermediates (India) Pvt Ltd., which will recover
waste heat from sulphuric acid production process to produce electricity, displacing part of
electricity supplied by the Indian Grid which predominantly relies on fossil fuel-fired power plants
for power generation.

A Heat Recovery System (HRS) will be installed to recover the waste heat, and the steam generated
by HRS will be exported to turbine to generate electricity. The power generation capacity is 20.5
MW, and 89,790 MWh/yr electricity is generated, and it is expected to reduce the GHG emissions
about 80,811 tCO2e over the full crediting period of the project activity by avoiding CO2 emissions
from electricity generation in fossil fuel power plants connected into the Indian Grid.

The project activity is a bundled project activity of total capacity of 20.5 MW (6.5 MW 14 MW),
and was installed & operated in Nandesari Village of Vadodara district in the Indian state of Gujarat
are per details listed below:

The start date of the project activity is the earliest commissioning date among both WHRS’s, which
is 24/05/2018. 

The power generated from the waste heat recovery system, displaces equivalent
amount of power from the Indian grid. The project activity results in reduced carbon emissions by
avoiding generation of this power in coal-based (fossil fuel based) grid connected power stations.

Type of GHG emissions mitigation action: Energy efficiency: Waste energy recovery to displace more-carbon intensive energy/
technology.
_______________
The generation of power from waste heat recovery system is a clean technology as there is no fossil
fuel fired or no GHG gases are emitted during the process. Thus, project activity leads to reduce the
GHG emissions. As per the ex-ante estimate, the project will generate approximately 89,790 MWh
of electricity per annum. The estimated annual average and the total CO2e emission reduction by the
project activity is expected to be 80,811 tCO2e per annum for the full crediting period of the project
activity, whereas actual emission reduction achieved during the first CoU period shall be submitted
as a part of first monitoring and verification.

Since the project activity generates electricity through waste heat recovery system, a clean
renewable energy source it will not cause any negative impact on the environment and thereby
contributes to climate change mitigation efforts
